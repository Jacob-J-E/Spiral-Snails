# Spiral-Snails
A computational solution to question 1 of "200 Puzzling Physics Problems":

"Three small snails are each at a vertex of an equilateral triangle of side 60cm. The first sets out towards the second, the second towards the third and the third towards the first, with a uniform speed of 5 cm*(min)^-1. During their motion each of them always heads towards its respective target snail. How much time has elapsed, and what distance do the snails cover, before they meet? What is the equation of their paths? If the snails are considered as point-masses, how many times does each circle their ultimate meeting point?"
